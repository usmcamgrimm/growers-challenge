Search and Replace Code Challenge

As part of the candidate assessment process at Growers, we ask for completion of a small code challenge.  It's a simple project, so please do not feel compelled to pull an all-nighter to get it done.  Do your best to show your personal coding style, while completing the following objectives.

Create a program that does the following:

1. Accept a file as input
2. Accept a string value as a "search parameter"
3. Accept a string value as a "replacement parameter"
4. Count every occurrence of the value of the "search parameter" in the file
5. Replace each occurance of the "search parameter" with the value of the "replacement parameter"
6. Save the file
7. Output the total number of occurrences of the "search parameter", and the total number of replacements.

Provide an original solution, do not use someone else's code.  Violating this rule will result in disqualification from the candidate assessment process.

Please complete this code challenge within the next 48 hours.  Provide a link to a repository containing your solution, or a zip file.
